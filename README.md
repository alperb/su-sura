Schedule wizard for SabancÄ± University. 

---

## Installation

You can use **sura** via npm:

```
npm install su-sura
```

## How to use

First we need to require **sura**:

```js
var courses =  ["MATH 102"]
var options = {}

const Sura = require('su-sura')
var SUWizard = new Sura(courses, options)
```

As the constructor generates a schedule, you can access it with the ```schedule``` property:

```js
SUWizard.schedule // is an 2d array with 5 sub-arrays each corresponds to a day
```

# API Reference

Sura's constructor does all the job for you as you construct it, however, if you'd like to access specific functions and variable you can call them anytime you want.

## Properties

### state

---

state property defines the program's current position. As the constructor starts its value is set to ```"STARTING"```. Then ```sortCourses()``` sets its value to ```"WORKING"```. At the end when a schedule is created ```rearrangeSchedule()``` sets its value to ```"SUCCESS"```. However, if it fails to create one, in ```createSchedule()``` its value is altered to ```"FAILED"```.
